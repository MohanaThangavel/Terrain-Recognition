# Terrain Recognition: Comparative Study of Image Classification Models

## Overview
This project investigates the effectiveness of different image classification models for terrain recognition, specifically **InceptionV3**, **ResNet50**, and **VGG16**. Using transfer learning, we adapted these models to classify various terrain types, assessing their performance and suitability for applications in autonomous navigation and geographic analysis.
